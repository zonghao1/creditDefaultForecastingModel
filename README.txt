Duplication File for STATGR5293 Applied Machine Learning for Financial Modeling
Assignment2-3: Credit Default Forecasting Model
code prepared by Zonghao Li   (zl2613@columbia.edu)

User should first load all the files (including the csv file ‘CreditModelData1.csv’) into working directory. Please remember to change file path.

File ‘CreditDefaultForecastingModel.ipynb’(which could be opened in jupiter notebook) was preferred for duplication since it could show the output for each step that is much more clear than python files. 

For python files:

0: Data cleaning and preparation
1: Fitting logistic regression model
2: Fitting decision tree model

‘CreditDefaultForecastingModel.py’ is a combination of the steps 0, 1, and 2.
